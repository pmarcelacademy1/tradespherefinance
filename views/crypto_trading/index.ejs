 cryptocurrency like bitcoin is a virtual currency traded peer-to-peer 
on a blockchain, independent of centralized authorities like banks and 
governments. Cryptocurrencies are entirely virtual, so they are not 
backed by physical commodities and have no intrinsic value.</div><br><div>How Do Cryptocurrencies Work?</div><div>Primarily,
 cryptocurrencies rely on blockchain technology to complete a 
transaction via an intricate P2P network. Once a transfer request is 
entered into the network, it is validated by the network and added to a 
pool of other transactions to create a block of data for the ledger, 
which is then entered into the existing blockchain. Once the block is 
successfully added to the chain, the transaction is approved and 
completed.</div><br><div>Are There Investment Opportunities with Cryptocurrencies?</div><div>Absolutely.
 Cryptocurrencies have become established investment commodities among 
major financial institutions and have even been adopted by countries 
such as Australia and Japan. As with any investment though, there are 
risks linked to market movements, high volatility and economics.</div></div></div></section></section>
