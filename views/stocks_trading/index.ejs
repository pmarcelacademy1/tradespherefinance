 CFD, or Contract for Difference, is a type of financial instrument that
 allows you to trade on the price movements of stocks, regardless of 
whether prices are rising or falling. The key advantage of a CFD is the 
opportunity to speculate on the price movements of an asset (upwards or 
downwards) without actually owning the underlying asset.</div><br><br><div>Stock
 trading has been a popular financial pursuit since stocks were first 
introduced by the Dutch East India Company in the 17th century. This is 
both an efficient and effective type of investment for both families and
 individuals.</div><br><br><br><div>What Are Stocks?</div><div>Stocks, 
also commonly referred to as equities or shares, are issued by a public 
corporation and put up for sale. Companies originally used stocks as a 
way of raising additional capital, and as a way to boost their business 
growth. When the company first puts these stocks up for sale, this is 
called the Initial Public Offering. Once this stage is complete, the 
shares themselves are then sold on the stock market, which is where any 
stock trading will occur.</div><br><br><div>People occasionally confuse 
buying shares with physically owning a portion of that company as if 
this somehow gives them the right to walk into the company offices and 
begin exerting their ownership rights over computers or furniture. The 
law treats this type of corporation in a unique way; as it is treated as
 a legal person, the corporation, therefore, owns its own assets. This 
is referred to as the separation of ownership and control.</div><br><br><div>The
 separation of these things is beneficial to both the shareholders and 
the corporation because it limits the liability for each party. For 
example, if a major shareholder were to go bankrupt, they cannot then 
sell assets belonging to the corporation to cover their debts and pay 
their creditors. This is the same in reverse; if a corporation you own 
shares in goes bankrupt and the judge orders them to sell all their 
assets, none of your own personal assets are at risk.</div><br><div>One thing lies at the core of a stock’s value: it entitles shareholders to a portion of the company profits.</div><br><br><br><div>How Do I Trade Stocks?</div><div>A
 stock market is where stocks are traded: where sellers and buyers come 
to agree on a price. Historically, stock exchanges existed in a physical
 location, and all transactions took place on the trading floor. One of 
the world’s most famous stock markets is the London Stock Exchange 
(LSE).</div><br><br><div>Yet as technology progresses, so does the stock
 market. Now we are seeing the rise of virtual stock exchanges that are 
made up of large computer networks will all trades performed 
electronically.</div><br><br><div>A company's shares can be traded on 
the stock market only following its IPO, making this a secondary market.
 The large businesses listed on global stock exchanges do not trade 
stocks on a frequent basis. Stocks can only be purchased from an 
existing shareholder, not directly from the company. This rule also 
applies in reverse, so when selling your shares, they go to another 
investor, not back to the corporation.</div><br><br><div>The reason 
traders choose to invest in stock is because the perceived value of a 
company can vary greatly over time. Money can be made or lost; it 
depends on whether the trader’s perceptions of the stock value are in 
line with the market.</div><br><br><div>Trying to predict the price 
movements of stocks in the short term is nearly impossible. Generally, 
stocks do tend to appreciate in value in the long term, so many 
investors choose to have a diverse portfolio of stocks that they intend 
to keep for a long time. Bigger companies pay dividends to their 
shareholders, which is a portion of the company’s profits. The value of 
the share itself will not impact the dividend.</div><br><div>In order to
 trade stocks, there must be a seller and a buyer; as not all traders 
have the same agenda, stocks are bought and sold at different times and 
for different reasons. Someone may sell their stock for profit, others 
sell it in order to cut losses, and some because they believe the value 
of the stock is about to change either way.</div><br><br><br><div>Stock Trading Risk Assessment</div><div>All
 forms of financial investment carry a level of risk, and stock trading 
is no different. Even traders with decades of experience cannot predict 
the correct price movements every single time.</div><br><br><div>People 
use various strategies, but it is important to note that there is no 
such thing as a failsafe strategy. It is also advisable to limit the 
amount of money you invest in a single trade, as part of your own risk 
management.</div></div></div></section></section>
