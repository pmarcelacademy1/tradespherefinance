 notice provides you with information about the risks associated with 
investment products, in which you may invest, through services provided 
to you by TradeSphereFinance Group entities.</div><br><br><div>Investment 
products offered by TradeSphereFinance include stocks, Exchange-Traded 
Funds (ETFs) and cryptocurrencies, in which you gain ownership of the 
underlying asset. In addition, TradeSphereFinance offers contracts for 
differences (CFDs) that offer exposure to currencies, commodities and 
indices.</div><br><div>Any transactions relating to stocks, ETFs or 
cryptocurrencies in which TradeSphereFinance offers you leverage (which is 
not currently available for cryptocurrencies) or allows you to enter 
into short transactions, and/or some copy trading transactions 
(including CopyPortfolios), shall be considered CFD transactions.</div><br><div>TradeSphereFinance
 also offers investors the opportunity to buy the underlying 
cryptocurrencies, stock or ETFs (i.e., BUY transactions for said assets 
using leverage 1) hold such assets and subsequently sell such assets. 
All transactions relating to cryptocurrencies are subject to the 
Cryptocurrencies Trading Addendum (“Cryptocurrencies Trading Addendum”).</div><br><div>Since
 Cryptocurrency markets are decentralised and non-regulated, our 
Cryptocurrencies Trading Services as such term is defined in the 
Cryptocurrencies Trading Addendum, are unregulated services which are 
not governed by any specific European regulatory framework (including 
MIFID). Therefore, when TradeSphereFinance (Europe) Ltd. customers use our 
Cryptocurrencies Trading Service, they will not benefit from the 
protections available to clients receiving regulated investment services
 such as access to the Investor Compensation Fund for Customers of 
Cypriot Investment Firms and the UK Financial Ombudsman Service for 
dispute resolution. TradeSphereFinance (Europe) Ltd. customers will 
continue to benefit from the rules relating to best execution and client
 money and safekeeping of client assets. TradeSphereFinance (UK) Ltd. 
customers using the Cryptocurrencies Trading Service only will not 
benefit from the protections available to clients receiving regulated 
investment services such as access to the Financial Services 
Compensation Scheme (FSCS) and the Financial Ombudsman Service for 
dispute resolution. We will endeavour to enable you to benefit from 
rules relating to best execution and safekeeping of client assets.</div><br><div>All
 of these products carry a high degree of risk and are not suitable for 
many investors. This notice provides you with information about the 
risks associated with these products, but it cannot explain all of the 
risks nor how such risks relate to your personal circumstances. If you 
are in doubt, you should seek professional advice. It is important that 
you fully understand the risks involved before deciding to trade with 
TradeSphereFinance, that you have adequate financial resources to bear such
 risks and that you monitor your positions carefully. Trading involves 
risk to your capital. You should not invest money that you cannot afford
 to lose, however, you cannot lose more than the equity in your account.</div><br><div>NOTWITHSTANDING
 ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND/OR THIS 
GENERAL RISK DISCLOSURE, FRENCH RESIDENTS SHALL BE ELIGIBLE TO INTRINSIC
 PROTECTION. ACCORDINGLY AND INDEPENDENTLY OF MARKET VOLATILITY, THEIR 
MAXIMUM LOSS WITH RESPECT TO EACH TRANSACTION SHALL BE THE TOTAL AMOUNT 
INVESTED IN SUCH TRANSACTION, AS UPDATED BY SUCH USER FROM TIME TO TIME.</div><br><br><br><br><div>CFDS</div><br><div>CFD
 stands for “Contract For Difference,” meaning you are not buying the 
underlying asset, but, rather, purchasing a contract to settle the 
difference in the initial and ending price of the asset. When trading 
CFDs, you generally trade on margin, which means you only have to 
deposit a small percentage of the overall value of your position. This 
is known as “Leverage”, and even small market movements may have great 
impact, negative or positive, on your trading account.</div><br><div>If 
the market moves against you, you may sustain a total loss greater than 
the funds invested in a specific position. You are responsible for all 
losses in your account up to the equity in your account.</div><br><div>Before
 deciding to trade on margin, you should carefully consider your 
investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. Our CFDs 
are not listed on any exchange. CFDs involve greater risk than investing
 in on-exchange products, as market liquidity cannot be guaranteed and 
it may be more difficult to liquidate an existing position. The prices 
and other conditions are set by us in accordance with our obligation to 
provide best execution as set out in our order execution policy, to act 
reasonably and in accordance with the applicable Terms and Conditions. 
The characteristics of our CFDs can vary substantially from the actual 
underlying market or instrument. Full details of all of our CFDs are set
 out on our website. In respect of corporate events, with respect to the
 underlying assets, we do not aim to make a profit from our clients from
 the outcome of corporate events such as rights issues, takeovers, 
mergers, share distributions or consolidations and open offers. We aim 
to reflect the treatment we receive, or, would receive if we were 
hedging our exposure to you in the underlying market. Ultimately, 
however, you are not dealing in the underlying market and, therefore, in
 relation to our CFDs, the treatment you receive may be less 
advantageous than if you owned the underlying instrument.</div><br><div>CFDs
 are complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing money 
rapidly due to leverage. 67% of retail investor accounts lose money when
 trading CFDs with this provider. You should consider whether you 
understand how CFDs work, and whether you can afford to take the high 
risk of losing your money.</div><br><div>CFDs are not suited to the 
long-term investor. If you hold a CFD open over a long period of time, 
the associated costs increase (such as overnight fees), and it may be 
more beneficial for you to buy the underlying asset instead. Sudden 
market movements, known as “gapping” may occur, causing a dramatic shift
 in the price of an underlying asset. Gapping may occur when the 
underlying market is closed, meaning the price on the underlying market 
may open at a significantly different level, and at a less advantageous 
price for you.</div><br><div>At all times during which you have open 
positions, you must ensure that your account meets our margin 
requirements, which may change from time to time. Therefore, if our 
price moves against you, or if our margin requirements have changed, you
 may need to provide us with significant additional funds to meet your 
margin requirement at short notice, to maintain your open positions. If 
you do not do this, we will be entitled to close one or more or all of 
your positions and you alone will be responsible for any losses incurred
 as a result.</div><br><br><br><br><div>Appropriateness</div><br><div>Before
 we open an account for you, we are required to make an assessment of 
whether the product(s) and/or services you have chosen are appropriate 
for you, and to warn you if, on the basis of the information you provide
 us, any product or service is not appropriate. If you decide to 
continue and open an account with us, you are confirming that you are 
aware of and understand the risks.</div><br><br><br><div>Position Monitoring</div><br><div>You
 should further ensure that you are able to monitor positions on your 
account at all times, as you are solely responsible for this. We are not
 responsible for monitoring positions on your account.</div><br><br><br><div>Copy Trading</div><br><div>TradeSphereFinance
 offers Social Trading Features. In making a decision to copy a specific
 trader or traders and/or follow a particular strategy, you must 
consider your entire financial situation, including financial 
commitments. You must understand that using Social Trading Features is 
highly speculative and that you could sustain significant losses 
exceeding the amount used to copy a trader or traders. The risks 
associated with Social Trading Features include, but are not limited to,
 automated trading execution whereby the opening and closing of trades 
will happen in your account without your manual intervention.</div><br><br><br><div>Trading risks</div><br><div>Since
 Cryptocurrency markets are decentralised and non-regulated, our 
Cryptocurrencies Trading Services are unregulated services which are not
 governed by any specific European regulatory framework (including 
MIFID). This means that there is no central bank that can take 
corrective measures to protect the value of Cryptocurrencies in a crisis
 or issue more currency. Therefore, when TradeSphereFinance (Europe) Ltd. 
customers use our Cryptocurrencies Trading Services, they will not 
benefit from the protections available to clients receiving regulated 
investment services such as access to the Investor Compensation Fund for
 Customers of Cypriot Investment Firms and the Financial Ombudsman 
Service for dispute resolution. TradeSphereFinance (Europe) Ltd. customers 
will continue to benefit from the rules relating to best execution and 
client money and safekeeping of client assets.</div><br><div>TradeSphereFinance
 (UK) Ltd. customers using Cryptocurrencies Services will not benefit 
from the protections available to clients receiving regulated investment
 services such as access to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme 
(FSCS) and the Financial Ombudsman Service for dispute resolution. We 
will endeavour to enable you to benefit from rules relating to best 
execution and safekeeping of client assets.</div><br><div>CRYPTOCURRENCY
 MARKETS ARE DETERMINED BY DEMAND AND SUPPLY ONLY. The  Cryptocurrency 
market is a dynamic arena and its respective prices are often highly 
unpredictable and volatile. The Cryptocurrency prices are usually not 
transparent, highly speculative and susceptible to market manipulation. 
In the worst-case scenario, the product could be rendered worthless.</div><br><div>It
 is important to make a distinction between indicative prices which are 
displayed on charts and dealable prices which are displayed on our 
trading platform. Indicative quotes only give an indication of where the
 market is. Because Cryptocurrency markets are decentralised, meaning 
they lack a single central exchange where all transactions are 
conducted, each market maker may quote slightly different prices. 
Therefore, any prices displayed on any chart made available by us or by a
 third party will only reflect “indicative” prices and not necessarily 
actual “dealing” prices where trades can be executed.</div><br><div>Cryptocurrency
 trading is prone to being misused for illegal activities due to the 
anonymity of transactions and investors would be adversely affected if 
law enforcement agencies were to investigate any alleged illicit 
activities.</div><br><div>ACCORDINGLY, CRYPTOCURRENCIES SHOULD BE SEEN 
AS AN EXTREMELY HIGH-RISK ASSET AND YOU SHOULD NEVER INVEST FUNDS THAT 
YOU CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE.</div><br><div>Given the foregoing, 
Cryptocurrencies are not appropriate for all investors. You should not 
deal in these products unless you have the necessary knowledge and 
expertise, understand these products’ characteristics and your exposure 
to risk. You should also be satisfied that the product is suitable for 
you in light of your circumstances and financial position. In addition, 
use of our Services can never be considered a safe investment, rather, 
only an investment with a high risk of loss inherently associated with 
them.</div><br><div>Furthermore, our own spread is added to online quotes which makes a trade on our websites even more volatile.</div><br><div>The
 risk of loss in trading Cryptocurrencies can be substantial. You 
should, therefore, carefully consider whether such trading is suitable 
for you in light of your circumstances and financial resources. You 
should be aware that you may sustain a total loss of the funds in your 
account. If the market moves against your position, we may ask you to 
provide a substantial amount of additional margin funds on short notice,
 in order to maintain your position. If you do not provide the required 
funds within the time frame required by us, your position may be 
liquidated at a loss, and you will be liable for any resulting deficit 
in your account.</div><br><div>TradeSphereFinance currently allows trading 
in cryptocurrencies over the weekend and it reserves the right not to do
 so. Should TradeSphereFinance so elect, trading in cryptocurrencies shall 
be allowed only from Monday through Friday. Given that the 
Cryptocurrency exchanges may operate over weekends, there may be a 
significant difference between Friday’s close and Sunday’s open. All 
such factors may result in you either not completing an order on a 
specific trading day or completing an order on a substantially less 
favourable price.</div><br><div>Under certain market conditions, you may
 find it difficult or impossible to liquidate a position. This can 
occur, for example, when the market reaches a daily price fluctuation 
limit (“limit move”), if there is insufficient liquidity in the market. 
Certain crypto assets may carry additional or specific risks.</div><br><div>Newly
 issued cryptocurrencies might carry additional risks you need to 
consider. Limited liquidity or difficulties to trade the asset after 
you’ve bought it. This means prices could be volatile, going up and down
 quickly, and liquidity may be limited, all depending on supply and 
demand. TradeSphereFinance cannot control these external factors.</div><br><br><br><br><div>Blockchain Risks</div><br><div>Since
 blockchain is an independent public peer-to peer network and is not 
controlled in any way or manner by TradeSphereFinance, TradeSphereFinance 
shall not be responsible for any failure and/or mistake and/or error 
and/or breach which shall occur in blockchain or in any other networks 
in which the Cryptocurrencies are being issued and/or traded. You will 
be bound and subject to any change and/or amendments in the blockchain 
system and subject to any applicable law which may apply to the 
blockchain. We make no representation or warranty of any kind, express 
or implied, statutory or otherwise, regarding the blockchain 
functionality nor for any breach of security in the blockchain.</div><br><br><br><div>Operation of Cryptocurrency Protocols</div><br><div>TradeSphereFinance
 does not own or control the underlying software protocols which govern 
the operation of Cryptocurrencies available for trading on our platform.
 In general, the underlying protocols are open source and anyone can 
use, copy, modify, and distribute them. TradeSphereFinance is not 
responsible for the operation of the underlying protocols and 
TradeSphereFinance makes no guarantee of their functionality, security, or 
availability. The underlying protocols are subject to sudden changes in 
operating rules (“Forks”), and such Forks may materially affect the 
value, function, and/or even the name of the Cryptocurrency 
TradeSphereFinance holds for your benefit. In the event of a Fork, 
TradeSphereFinance may temporarily suspend TradeSphereFinance operations (with
 or without advance notice) and TradeSphereFinance may (a) configure or 
reconfigure its systems or (b) decide not to support (or cease 
supporting) the Forked protocol entirely. TradeSphereFinance may, but is 
not obligated to do so, adjust your account in respect of a Fork, 
depending on the circumstances of each event attributable to any 
specific Cryptocurrency which you hold.</div><br><br><br><br><br><div>Third-party Risks.</div><br><div>We
 may elect to execute any order and/or hold any fiat money and 
cryptocurrencies via a Third Party. Such Third Parties are not banks 
that hold their fiat money/virtual currency as a deposit. If any such 
Third Party loses any money, fails or goes out of business, there is no 
specific legal protection that covers you for losses arising from any 
funds you may have held with such a Third Party, even when such party is
 registered with a national authority. Depending on the structure and 
security of the TradeSphereFinance Money crypto wallet, some individuals 
may be vulnerable to hacks, resulting in the theft of virtual currency 
or loss of customer assets. TradeSphereFinance will not be responsible in 
the event of losses caused by those Third Parties.</div><br><div>Delisting
 and/or unsupported Cryptocurrencies: if at any time any of the 
Cryptocurrencies form the subject of your order are delisted and/or we 
no longer support the trading in such Cryptocurrencies for any reason, 
then the applicable order will be immediately closed. If TradeSphereFinance
 is notified that a Cryptocurrency you hold in your account is likely to
 be delisted and/or removed and/or cancelled from any of the exchanges 
(some of them or all) and TradeSphereFinance believes that it shall not be 
able to trade in such Cryptocurrencies, TradeSphereFinance shall make an 
effort to sell the Cryptocurrencies on your behalf at such time and 
price, and in such manner, as it determines.</div><br><br><br><br><br><br><div>Automated Trading &amp; Internet Risks</div><br><div>While
 trading on our website and/or applications, system errors may occur. 
You should be aware of the risks that may result from any system failure
 which could mean that your order may be delayed or fail.</div><br><div>You
 acknowledge that there are risks associated with utilising an 
Internet-based trading system including, but not limited to, the failure
 of hardware, software, and Internet connections, the risk of malicious 
software introduction, the risk that third parties may obtain 
unauthorized access to information and/or assets (including your 
Cryptocurrencies) stored on your behalf, cyber attack, Cryptocurrency 
network failure (such as blockchain), computer viruses, communication 
failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience 
when trading via the Services, howsoever caused, spyware, scareware, 
Trojan horses, worms or other malware that may affect your computer or 
other equipment, or any phishing, spoofing or other attack. You should 
also be aware that SMS and email services are vulnerable to spoofing and
 phishing attacks and should use care in reviewing messages purporting 
to originate from TradeSphereFinance.</div><br><br><br><br><br><br><div>Fees and Costs</div><br><div>Our
 fees and charges are set out on our website TradeSphereFinance.com under 
the ‘Fees’ section. Please be aware of all costs and charges that apply 
to you, because such costs and charges will affect your profitability.</div><br><br><br><br><br><div>Information</div><br><div>Any
 opinions, news, research, analyses, prices, or other information 
contained on this website are provided as general market commentary, and
 do not constitute investment advice. TradeSphereFinance shall not be 
responsible for any loss arising from any investment based on any 
recommendation, forecast or other information provided.</div><br><br><br><br><br><div>SPAC Risks</div><br><div>Investing
 in SPACs carries different risks to investing in other stocks on 
TradeSphereFinance. Unlike other listed companies, SPACs are shell 
companies when they become public and, therefore, they do not have an 
underlying operating business. This means that you are relying on the 
managers of the SPACs to realise your investment. There is no guarantee 
that SPACs will be managed by individuals and firms that may not be 
competent or qualified to do so. You should read the SPAC’s IPO 
prospectus and any reports or other key information documents filed or 
published to understand the terms of your investments and the economic 
interests and motivations of the SPAC you are investing in.  Moreover, 
SPACs that do not carry out an acquisition within a certain time period 
will be liquidated. As a result, there is a risk that you may not 
recover some or all of the money directly invested by you into the SPAC.</div></div></div></section></section>
